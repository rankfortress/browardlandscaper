	Our team at Broward County Landscaping is here to make maintaining your commercial and residential landscaping easier than ever. We are a locally owned and operated business helping residential and commercial property owners in Fort Lauderdale and the surrounding areas for over 25 years. We handle various projects, including monthly maintenance landscaping contracts, design, installation of landscapes, and repair and cleanup of your property. Our focus is to help you keep your yard looking good. We make sure to install plants that can withstand the sub-tropical climates in South Florida that make it challenging for certain types of plants and grasses to grow well. Our thorough knowledge of the area helps make sure you don't end up with wrong plants and trees for your property.
	
	We focus on customer service, prompt attention, and budget-conscious planning. We are licensed and insured and pride ourselves on developing unique and beautiful landscaping plans.
